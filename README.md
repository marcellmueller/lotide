# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @marcelmueller/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@marcelmueller/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

- `assertArraysEqual(...)`: assertion check for eqArrays
- `assertObjectsEqual(...)`: assertion check for eqObjects
- `assertEqual(...)`: uses strict comparison on two values
- `countLetters(...)`: take in a string and then return a count of each of the letters in that string
- `countOnly(...)`: takes in a collection of items and return counts for a specific subset of those items
- `eqArrays(...)`: calls eqArrays and returns a message to console if arrays are the same
- `eqObjects(...)`: function that can compare two arrays for a perfect match.
- `findKey(...)`: checks if key exists in object
- `findKeyByValue(...)`: which takes in an object and a value. It will scan the object and return the first key which contains the given value. If no key with that given value is found, then it willreturn undefined.
- `flatten(...)`: 'Flattens' nested array elements into a single array
- `head(...)`: returns the first element of an array
- `letterPositions(...)`: return all the indices (zero-based positions) in the string where each character is found.
- `map(...)`: cThe map function will return a new array based on the results of the callback function.
- `middle(...)`: Returns the middle value of an array. If array is even, returns the middle two.
- `tail(...)`: Returns an array with the first element removed
- `atakeUntil(...)`: The function will return a "slice of the array with elements taken from the beginning." It will keep going until the callback/predicate returns a truthy value.
- `without(...)`: Removes unwanted items from an array
